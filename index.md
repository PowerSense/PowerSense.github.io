This open-source Julia package has tools at the cross-section of Power System Operations, Applied Mathematics, High-Performance Computations, and Machine-Learning. Here are the descriptions of the different features of the package.

# Nonlinear Programming (NLP)
The package implements active set methods for continuous nonlinear optimization. The package currently implements sequential linear programming methods.

# Power Flow Analysis
The package implements power flow analysis for a transmission system. The tool also implements an interference for OpenDSS.

# Optimal Power Flow
The package implements specialized algorithms for solving alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF). The package is planned to implement specialized algorithms in three categories:
*   ACOPF for transmission systems (ongoing)
*   Co-optimization of FACTS devices and transmission systems dispatch (future work)
*   Co-optimization of transmission systems, FACTS devices, and distributions systems for a DERs-rich grid. (future work)
