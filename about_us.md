Powersense Lab is founded and maintained by [Sayed Abdullah Sadat](https://www.sayedsadat.com). Dr. Sayed Abdullah Sadat is the Founder & Principal Consultant at Powersense, advising utilities, ISOs/RTOs, and energy investors on market analytics and grid planning. He earned a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Utah and completed postdoctoral research in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California San Diego. With 5+ years of industry experience in power markets and transmission planning, his work spans power market analytics, transmission systems, and active distribution networks.

His expertise lies in applying parallel and high-performance computing; linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization; and sequential decision analytics—including dynamic programming and reinforcement learning—to power-system analysis. He builds production-grade methods and software that turn complex data into actionable insights, enabling resilient operations, robust planning, and investment-ready decisions across the grid.
